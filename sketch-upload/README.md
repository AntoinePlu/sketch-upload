# Introduction

This [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch) plugin allows designers to upload the selected artboard or slice to
[Cloud App](http://www.getcloudapp.com/) with a simple shortcut (⇧⌘U).
The plugin works by exporting the first slice named `Preview` to Sketch's cache
directory and uploading that file via Cloud App.


# Installation

Just [download]()

# Compatibility

This plugin was developed with the App Store version of Sketch 2.2.4 and Cloud App 2.0

#Thanks

Huge thanks to 
[Marc Schwieterman](https://github.com/marcisme) ([@mschwieterman](https://twitter.com/mschwieterman) / [@mbs](https://app.net/mbs)) for making all this possible!

This plugin is largely based on his [sketch-preview plugin](https://github.com/marcisme/sketch-preview), with a few tweeks from [David Klawitter](https://github.com/davidklaw) and his fork of [sketch-preview](https://github.com/davidklaw/sketch-preview).
