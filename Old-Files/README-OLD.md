Sketch Plugins
==============

All of my plugins for sketch, including but not limited to plugins I have forked and edited.

> I have moved the plugins to their own repo's for versioning, issues, and organization purposes. I don't know what I was thinking.

# [Upload](https://github.com/jelias/sketch-plugins/tree/master/sketch-upload)

A simple plugin for designers. Upload the selected artboard or slice to Cloud App with a simple shortcut: `⇧⌘U`

>Note: Other upload services such as Droplr also work.
